# kb-remap

Tool to assist remapping macOS keyboard keys.

## 🚀 Getting started

Install the tool using Cargo.

```sh
cargo install kb-remap
```

## 🤸 Usage

Running the tool without any options will list the available HID devices.
```sh
$ kb-remap --list
```
```text

0x5ac      0x342       Apple Internal Keyboard / Trackpad
0xc45      0x7692      USB Keyboard

0x5ac      0x342       Apple Internal Keyboard / Trackpad
0xc45      0x7692      USB Keyboard
0x4c       0x269       Magic Mouse
0x0        0x0         Headset
```

Usually it's pretty simple to pick out which devices are keyboards. Using the
name listed above as `--name` you can remap any key you want using the `--map`
or `--swap` options. For example the following remaps capslock to backspace and
swaps § (section) and ` (backtick) on a the internal macOS keyboard.
```sh
$ kb-remap \
  --name "Apple Internal Keyboard / Trackpad" \
  --map capslock:delete --swap '0x64:`'
```

You can reset the mapping using:
```sh
$ kb-remap --name "Apple Internal Keyboard / Trackpad" --reset
```

The `--map` and `--swap` options both expect the source and destination keys to
be specified and separated by a ":" (colon).

There are three ways to specify keys:

- **Name:** some keys you can specify using their name. For example the Return
  key "⏎" can be specified as "return". These are added on a convenience basis.
- **Character:** most typeable keys can be specified using their character. For
  example: the A key can be specified using "A" or "a".
- **Number:** any key can be specified by using the USB usage ID in decimal or
  hex. For example: Z has a usage ID of "29", which can also be specified as
  "0x1d".

## 🤔 Why? How?

Powerful applications to remap macOS keys like [Karabiner-Elements] are often
overkill for simple remappings. Additionally, they can sometimes take a while to
support the latest macOS version. I wanted a simple reliable solution.

Instead of a constantly running application `kb-remap` simply subprocesses to
the built-in macOS  `hidutil` command to fetch keyboard information and to remap
keys. This remapping does not persist if keyboards are unplugged or **if your
Mac goes to sleep**. `kb-remap` does not solve this problem for you yet. One
option is to install a launchd service to automatically run `kb-remap`.
