# kb-remap

Tool to assist remapping macOS keyboard keys.

## üöÄ Getting started

Install the tool using Cargo.

```sh
cargo install kb-remap
```

## ü§∏ Usage

Running the tool without any options will list the available USB devices.
```sh
$ kb-remap
```
```text
Found the following USB devices:
  Apple T2 Controller
  Ambient Light Sensor
  Headset
  Touch Bar Backlight
  FaceTime HD Camera (Built-in)
  Touch Bar Display
  Apple Internal Keyboard / Trackpad
  USB Keyboard
```

Usually it's pretty simple to pick out which devices are keyboards. Using the
name listed above as `--name` you can remap any key you want using the `--map`
or `--swap` options. For example the following remaps capslock to backspace and
swaps ¬ß (section) and ` (backtick) on a the internal macOS keyboard.
```sh
$ kb-remap \
  --name "Apple Internal Keyboard / Trackpad" \
  --map capslock:delete --swap '0x64:`'
```

You can reset the mapping using:
```sh
$ kb-remap --name "Apple Internal Keyboard / Trackpad" --reset
```

The `--map` and `--swap` options both expect the source and destination keys to
be specified and separated by a ":" (colon).

There are three ways to specify keys:

- **Name:** some keys you can specify using their name. For example the Return
  key "‚èé" can be specified as "return". These are added on a convenience basis.
- **Character:** most typeable keys can be specified using their character. For
  example: the A key can be specified using "A" or "a".
- **Number:** any key can be specified by using the USB usage ID in decimal or
  hex. For example: Z has a usage ID of "29", which can also be specified as
  "0x1d".

## ü§î Why? How?

Powerful applications to remap macOS keys like [Karabiner-Elements] are often
overkill for simple remappings. Additionally, they can sometimes take a while to
support the latest macOS version. I wanted a simple reliable solution.

Instead of a constantly running application `kb-remap` simply subprocesses to
built-in macOS `ioreg` and `hidutil` commands to fetch keyboard information and
to remap keys. This remapping does not persist if keyboards are unplugged or
**if your Mac goes to sleep**. `kb-remap` does not solve this problem for you
yet. One option is to install plist file to
