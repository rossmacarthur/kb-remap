# kb-remap

Tool to assist remapping macOS keyboard keys.

## üöÄ Getting started

Install the tool using Cargo.

```sh
cargo install kb-remap
```

## ü§∏ Usage

Running the tool without any options will list the available HID devices.
```sh
$ kb-remap --list
```
```text
Vendor ID  Product ID  Name
---------  ----------  ----------------------------------
0x0        0x0         BTM
0x0        0x0         Headset
0x4c       0x269       Magic Mouse
0x5ac      0x342       Apple Internal Keyboard / Trackpad
0x5ac      0x342       Keyboard Backlight
0xc45      0x7692      USB Keyboard
0x1050     0x407       YubiKey OTP+FIDO+CCID
```

Usually it's pretty simple to pick out which devices are keyboards. Using the
name listed above as `--name` you can remap any key you want using the `--map`
or `--swap` options. For example the following remaps capslock to backspace and
swaps ¬ß (section) and ` (backtick) on a the internal macOS keyboard.
```sh
$ kb-remap --name "Apple Internal Keyboard / Trackpad" --map capslock:delete --swap '0x64:`'
```

You can reset the mapping using:
```sh
$ kb-remap --name "Apple Internal Keyboard / Trackpad" --reset
```

If you want you can inspect the raw `hidutil` command that would be run for
a particular command using the `--dump` option.
```
$ kb-remap --name "Apple Internal Keyboard / Trackpad" --map capslock:delete --dump
```

Would output the following:
```
hidutil property \
    --matching '{"VendorID":1452,"ProductID":834}' \
    --set '{"UserKeyMapping":[{"HIDKeyboardModifierMappingSrc":30064771129,"HIDKeyboardModifierMappingDst":30064771114}]}'
```

## Specifying keys

The `--map` and `--swap` options both expect the source and destination keys to
be specified and separated by a ":" (colon).

There are three ways to specify keys:

### Name

Some keys you can specify using their name. For example the Return (Enter) key
"‚èé" can be specified as "return". These are added on a convenience basis.

| Key                | Code       | USB Usage ID |
| ------------------ | ---------- | ------------ |
| Return (Enter)     | `return`   | 0x28         |
| Escape             | `escape`   | 0x29         |
| Delete (Backspace) | `delete`   | 0x2A         |
| Caps Lock          | `capslock` | 0x39         |
| Left Control       | `lcontrol` | 0xE0         |
| Left Shift         | `lshift`   | 0xE1         |
| Left Option        | `loption`  | 0xE2         |
| Left Command       | `lcommand` | 0xE3         |
| Right Control      | `rcontrol` | 0xE4         |
| Right Shift        | `rshift`   | 0xE5         |
| Right Option       | `roption`  | 0xE6         |
| Right Command      | `rcommand` | 0xE7         |

Additionally, the following special names are available and map multiple keys
if they are used.

| Keys                 | Code      |
| -------------------- | --------- |
| Left & Right Control | `control` |
| Left & Right Shift   | `shift`   |
| Left & Right Option  | `option`  |
| Left & Right Command | `command` |

### Character

Most typeable keys can be specified using their character. For example: the A
key can be specified using "A" or "a". The USB usage ID used will the one that
the key corresponds to on a US keyboard.

### Number

Any key can be specified by using the USB usage ID in decimal or hex. For
example: Z has a usage ID of "29", which can also be specified as "0x1d".

## ü§î Why? How?

Powerful applications to remap macOS keys like [Karabiner-Elements] are often
overkill for simple remappings. Additionally, they can sometimes take a while to
support the latest macOS version. I wanted a simple reliable solution.

Instead of a constantly running application `kb-remap` simply subprocesses to
the built-in macOS  `hidutil` command to fetch keyboard information and to remap
keys. This remapping does not persist if keyboards are unplugged or **if your
Mac goes to sleep**. `kb-remap` does not solve this problem for you yet. One
option is to install a launchd service to automatically run `kb-remap`.
